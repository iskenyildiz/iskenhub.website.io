# SQL vs NOSQL

SQL is a relational database which defines relationships in form of tables.

NoSQL (created in 1998)  is a non relational database which is easy to scale. NoSQL is used for big data and real time web apps. Used for documents, Graph databases or wide column stores.

SQL uses SQL language for defining and manipulating data, NoSQL uses Unstructured Query language (UnQL).

SQL databases are better for complex queries.

SQL databases can manage increasing load by increasing CPU, RAM, SSD since they were designed to run on a single server whereas NoSQL just adds more servers to the infrastructure, which makes them the preferred method when dealing with large or constantly increasing data sets.

NoSQL databases are quickly becoming a major part of the database landscape today.

NoSQL has many ways for implementation, making it more diverse than SQL which has standartised implementation techniques. This makes NoSQL’s performance for reading and writing better than normal SQL.

# DOCKER


Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.

# InfluxDB

InfluxDB is a time series database (TSDB) is a database optimized for time-stamped or time series data. Time series data are simply measurements or events, such as performance, network, click monitoring as well as sensor data that are tracked, monitored over time. Time series is the fastest growing database category in today’s standards.

Grafana is one of the most popular time series data visualization tools.

Legacy system refers to outdated computer systems, programming languages or app software that are used instead of available upgraded versions.
